      <description>There are some projects do have ISO file for downloading. That means you could run this solution with in 20 minutes on a physics machine or a vmware session. You can just download this ISO image file and burn it on a blank cd; then you will insert it into DVD/CD driver of your target machine, after press few enter keys; You finally got all software on this box. Reboot this machine, you get everything up an running on it; including a Linux OS and everything which the solution depends on.</description>
