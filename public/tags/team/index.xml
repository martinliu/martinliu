      <description>建议所有管理者都可以反思一下：是否需要supper chicken 团队。先看下这个视频。 http://video-subtitle.tedcdn.com/talk/podcast/2015W/None/MargaretHeffernan_2015W-480p-zh-tw.mp4
About the book In this wise and witty guide to creating strong company culture, business leader Margaret Heffernan lays the groundwork for a new kind of thinking: Organizations can create seismic shifts by making deceptively small changes.
Far beyond a prescriptive list, this book spills over with fascinating anecdotes from organizations around the world. Heffernan reveals the surprisingly small changes any organization can make: how to empower every person as a leader: how to open channels as a real, active listening; the important of cutting back hours (and also leaning into crunch time); why leaving the office does wonders for your working brain; how conflict works as an essential tool for creative thinking; why companies that actively solicit involvement beyond their walls are so much more effective; how simple activities strengthen social capital between workers.</description>
