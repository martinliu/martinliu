<br /><br />Today I installed gOS on my laptop; openSuSE did great work for me 3 years. I'd like to play some new things. So, check my new desktop out.<br /><br />[http://picasaweb.google.com/liuzh66/GOS](http://picasaweb.google.com/liuzh66/GOS)<br /><br />If you go its wetsite http://thinkgos.com/, you will see it talks lots of cloud. It's interesting, but it is not the reson i chose it. Ubuntu 8.04 is inside gOS. So, it time to learn a new linux system. I neve use a Derbin based system, I'm not sure it could run for me how long.
