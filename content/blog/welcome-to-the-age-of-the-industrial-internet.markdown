subtitle: 'Everyone''s talking about the "Internet of Things," but what exactly
  does that mean for our future? In this thoughtful talk, economist Marco Annunziata
  looks at how technology is transforming the industrial sector, creating machines
  that can see, feel, sense and react â€” so they can be operated far more efficiently.
  Think: airplane parts that send an alert when they need to be serviced, or wind
  turbines that communicate with one another to generate more electricity. It''s a
  future with exciting implications for us all. '
